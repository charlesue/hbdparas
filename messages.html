  <div class="message left">Hello, my dearest Frances.

I’ll keep this short because you know I’m not really good with this. Happiest Birthday my honeybunch sugarplum.

I want you to know how much peace and calmness you bring into my life. With you, I can truly be myself because you know who Claire really is. That kind of friendship is rare, and I treasure it more than I can say.

God knows how deeply grateful I am to have you and Lia by my side. I pray that this friendship continues to grow and lasts for as long as we want  to, sana forever no Hahahah

Happy birthday ulit. Mahal ko kayo palagi❤️

  <div class="message left">Happy Birthday to the most important person in my life, 

I don’t even know where to begin because there aren’t enough words to explain how much you mean to me. You’re not just my best friend—you're my person. My safe place. The one I run to with good news, bad news, random thoughts, and unnecessary drama. Life genuinely feels softer and brighter with you in it.

Paras, you’ve been there for me in ways I don’t think I even say thank you for enough. You listen to me when I overthink, you hype me up when I doubt myself, and you somehow always know exactly what to say. You’ve seen every side of me—the emotional, the dramatic, the stressed, the happiest—and you never left. It means everything to me.

I’m so proud of you, Frances. The person you are is such a masterpiece. You’re kind, strong, funny, and beautiful inside and out, and you have this light about you that makes people feel comfortable and loved. I hope this year is filled with peace, success, genuine happiness, and everything you’ve been quietly wishing for. I hope this new age brings you growth, blessings, and moments that make you feel so loved—because you truly are.

No matter what happens in life, just know I’m always here. Through every breakdown, every glow-up, every random late-night talk, every big dream. 

Please don't be a strangers. 

I love you forever, my Paras !! ❤️ - Julia</div>
